# SBTToken
This was part of an r&d project for an algorithmic stable coin (back when those were the hottest ponzis around).

The trend was ever shortening epochs, so the concept here was an epoch of 0, with continuous token streaming of burn/ rewards.

This contract borrows from sablier token streaming, and ampleforth rebasing - which allows the token balance in a wallet to increase or decrease in real time. It was pretty cool, but added a lot of overhead to gas costs for a normal transaction, so it was abandoned.

Thanks for reading!
